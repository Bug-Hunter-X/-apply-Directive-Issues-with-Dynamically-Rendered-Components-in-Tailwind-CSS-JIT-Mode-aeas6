The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a component that's dynamically rendered or conditionally applied.  If the component isn't rendered initially, or its classes change after mounting, the `@apply` directives might not be processed correctly by Tailwind's JIT mode. This often leads to unexpected styling or no styling at all, especially when the components are rendered using Javascript frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.

For example:
```javascript
//React Component
function MyComponent({ showComponent }) {
  return (
    <div className={showComponent ? "bg-blue-500 @apply text-white p-4" : ""}></div>
  );
}
```
If `showComponent` is initially `false`, and then changes to `true`, Tailwind may not correctly apply the styles within the `@apply` directive. This will only occur when using `@apply` with dynamically changed classes within a component.
