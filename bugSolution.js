Several approaches can mitigate this issue:

1. **Avoid `@apply` for dynamic classes:**  The most reliable solution is to avoid using `@apply` for classes that change dynamically. Instead, directly apply the utility classes as needed. This is often more performant and cleaner.

2. **Force a re-render:**  In some frameworks, forcing a re-render of the component after the classes change ensures Tailwind's JIT mode processes the updated `@apply` directives. This typically involves techniques like setting a state variable that triggers a re-render.

3. **Use a framework-specific solution:** Some frameworks have specific techniques for handling dynamic styles that work better with Tailwind's JIT compilation. Consult your framework's documentation for best practices.

4. **Ensure that the component is rendered at least once initially.** By ensuring that the component and its related @apply directives are processed during the initial rendering, you are more likely to avoid this kind of error. This may involve conditional rendering with some default values. 

**Example solution using state and re-render (React):**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(false);
  const [componentClasses, setComponentClasses] = useState("");

  const toggleComponent = () => {
    setShowComponent(!showComponent);
    setComponentClasses(showComponent ? "" : "bg-blue-500 text-white p-4"); // update component classes
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleComponent}>Toggle Component</button>
      <div className={componentClasses}>
        {/* Content goes here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
